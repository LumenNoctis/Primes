# Sieve_of_Eratosthenes

*Sift the Two's and Sift the Three's*
*The Sieve of Eratosthenes.*
*When the multiples sublime,*
*The numbers the remain are Prime*

## All the power of the primes, at the tip of your mouse

Run: ./Sieve [number] [output_file]

**number** as the max value of the primes generated
**output** as the output filename

----

## Up(or never)coming features

Format type :

./Sieve "min=x max=y amoutn=z output=a"

**Where:**

- *min* Minimum prime value
- *max* Maximum prime value
- *amount* Maximum amount of primes generated
- *output* output filename (If the filename is a number, write to corresponding file descriptor)


Implement Eratosthenes (inc & segmented)

Sieve of Atkins to look into for more uwu



























*Disclaimer: This is actually Euler's Sieve, not Erathostene's >.> hehe gottem*
